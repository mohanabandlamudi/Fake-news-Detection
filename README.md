# Fake News Detection using Natural Language Processing

This project implements a machine learning-based solution for detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes text content to classify news articles as either real or fake.

## Features

- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques
- Machine learning model for classification
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Interactive Jupyter notebook for analysis and visualization

  ## Working

- Loads and merges real and fake news datasets
- Cleans and preprocesses text using NLP techniques
- Extracts features using:
  - CountVectorizer
  - TF-IDF
  - Word2Vec
- Trains models using Logistic Regression
- Evaluates models using classification reports and confusion matrices
- Visualizes word clouds and label distribution

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries Used

| Library | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `pandas`, `numpy` | Data loading and manipulation |
| `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud` | Visualization |
| `nltk` | Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization |
| `sklearn` | Machine learning and feature extraction |
| `gensim` | Word2Vec embeddings |

## üìä Data Description

- `Fake.csv`: Contains fake news articles
- `True.csv`: Contains true news articles

After loading:
- A `label` column is added:
  - `1` = True news
  - `0` = Fake news

## üßπ Text Preprocessing

### ‚úÖ Steps performed:

1. **Lowercasing**: `Text ‚Üí text`
2. **Removing punctuation**: Removes `. , ! ? etc.`
3. **Removing stopwords**: Removes common words like ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúis‚Äù
4. **Removing HTML tags and URLs**
5. **Removing words with digits**
6. **Lemmatization**: Converts words to their dictionary form (`running ‚Üí run`)
