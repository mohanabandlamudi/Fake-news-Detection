# Fake News Detection using Natural Language Processing

This project implements a machine learning-based solution for detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes text content to classify news articles as either real or fake.

## Features

- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques
- Machine learning model for classification
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Interactive Jupyter notebook for analysis and visualization

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:

```bash
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
nltk
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter
```

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `text_processing_ml.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation
  - Data preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Results visualization

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd FakeNewsDetection
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook text_processing_ml.ipynb
```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Train the model
   - Evaluate the results
   - Visualize the findings

## Model Details

The project uses various NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify news articles. The implementation includes:

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization)
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF, word embeddings)
- Classification algorithms
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
